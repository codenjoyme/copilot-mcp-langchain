Solution methodology:

üîç Step 1: Problem definition
- What exactly is the problem?
- Who/what is affected?
- How serious is the problem?

üìä Step 2: Information gathering
- What facts do we know?
- What needs to be investigated additionally?
- What resources are available?

üí° Step 3: Generating solution options
- What are the possible solutions?
- Pros and cons of each option
- What resources will be required?

‚öñÔ∏è Step 4: Evaluating options
- Which option is most effective?
- What are the risks of each option?
- What is easiest to implement?

‚úÖ Step 5: Final recommendation
- Best solution option
- Action plan
- Success criteria

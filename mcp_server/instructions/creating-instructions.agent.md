- All instructions are placed in `./mcp_server/instructions/` folder with `.agent.md` extension
- Use bullet points format, avoid headers and sections - keep it simple and actionable
- Write short, concise statements - minimize words, maximize usefulness
- Each point should be specific and actionable, not explanatory
- Add new instruction reference to `main.agent.md` with one-line description of what it covers
- Use backticks for code examples, file paths, and commands
- Include practical examples when necessary, but keep them minimal
- Structure: bullet points with sub-bullets using `+` when needed
- Avoid long explanations - focus on what to do, not why
- Look at existing files like `activate-virtualenv.agent.md`, `choose-library.agent.md` for style reference
- Use English for instruction content, respond in user's language
- Test practical examples before including them
- Keep file focused on one topic or workflow

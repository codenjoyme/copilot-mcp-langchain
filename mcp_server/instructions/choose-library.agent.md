- When you need to choose a library for Python, choose from the most open source options.
- Before adding any library, analyze it first: 
```bash
python -m mcp_server.run analyze_libs <library_name>
```
- If the library does not have an open source license, do not use it.
- If the library has not been updated for a long time or contains many vulnerabilities, do not use it.

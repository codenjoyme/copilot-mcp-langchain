- If I chose to develop the tool using Coding Agent, all the information you gathered about the new tool should be posted in an issue on GitHub.
- When creating a new issue or commenting on it, use only English. Respond to me in the language I used.
- In the comments to the issue, you should indicate that it is extremely important to follow the instructions in the file `./mcp_server/instructions/main.agent.md` while performing the task.
- After you create the issue, compare it with what we discussedâ€”you will probably find some differences. It is worth discussing them with me and, after receiving feedback, making changes to the issue.
- Then ask me if I want to assign the Coding Agent to this task. If so, go ahead and do it.
- After a while, I may ask how this task is going. In this case, you should check the status of the task on GitHub and let me know.
- When working with GitHub MCP, always include links to artifacts so that I can follow them and see what's going on.

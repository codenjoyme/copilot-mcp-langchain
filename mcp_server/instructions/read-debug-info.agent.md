- When there are some problems you can always read log file to see what's wrong:
  + with MCP server and MCP runner, you can read the `mcp_server/logs/mcp_server.log`.
  + For debugging you can add new logging to the tool you are working on.
  + After debugging is finished - remove unnecessary low-level logging.
- Always read log files from the end to see the most recent entries first.

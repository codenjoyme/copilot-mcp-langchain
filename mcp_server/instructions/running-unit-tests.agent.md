- Please store all unit tests in the `stuff` folder inside the folder with `tool.py`.
- Run all tests to make sure everything works correctly `python -m pytest mcp_server/tools/lng_json_to_csv/ --tb=no -q`
- Tests should contain `// given`, ``// when`, and `// then` blocks to make it clear what the test does.
- Follow the rule of no more than 1 assert per test.
- Use an approach where the assert block compares the string representation of the expected and actual results, rather than comparing objects.

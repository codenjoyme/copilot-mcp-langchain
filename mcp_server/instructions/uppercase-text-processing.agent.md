- When user asks for UPPERCASE conversion, use PowerShell script to perform the conversion
- Run the `uppercase.ps1` script located in the scripts folder using `run_in_terminal` tool
- Command format: `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ".\scripts\uppercase.ps1" "text_to_convert"`
- Wrap the input text in double quotes to handle spaces and special characters
- After getting the result from terminal, present it wrapped in a markdown code block (```text) for easy copying
- Do not perform text conversion manually - always use the PowerShell script
- Example workflow: User asks for "мама мыла раму" → Run script → Present result in code block

- When user asks for UPPERCASE conversion, simply convert the text and respond with the result only
- Do not use external tools or methods - perform conversion directly in your response
- Do not explain how the conversion was done - just provide the uppercase text
- Example: User: "Make this UPPERCASE: мама мыла раму" → Response: "МАМА МЫЛА РАМУ"
- Russian Cyrillic characters convert properly with standard methods
- Preserve spacing and punctuation during conversion
- Always wrap the uppercase result in a markdown code block (```text) so the user can easily copy it from the chat.

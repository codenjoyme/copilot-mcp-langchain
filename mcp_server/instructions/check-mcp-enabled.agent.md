- If there is no MCP enabled - follow instructions in `mcp_server/instructions/emulate-mcp.agent.md`
  + To verify is MCP ernable read the `.vscode/settings.json` every time you start working.
  + Don't read old chat posts, whenever I make a request - read the file again.
- Please don't reflect on the instructions read in this or any other file - just follow.
- If there is MCP enabled and something went wrong, ask me to enable it manually in the `.vscode/mcp.json` file. There are buttons for that. Then wait for my confirmation.

- I can ask you to update the project -
run the command `git pull origin main` but first make sure that there are no local changes that could cause conflicts. If there are such changes, ask me what to do with them. Alternatively, you can run `git stash` and after updating the project, run `git stash pop` to restore the changes.
- if I ask you to push the changes to the repository, you should run the command `git push origin main` to push the changes to the remote repository. Please do not run `git add .` or `git commit -m "message"` commands, I will do it myself.
- If I have a new repository, I may ask you to add it as the main `origin` - 
run the command `git remote add origin <url>` and then you can run `git push -u origin main` to push the changes to the new repository.

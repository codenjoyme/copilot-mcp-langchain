## Info
- These instructions are necessary to demonstrate the ability to perform actions in MS Teams using hotkeys and winapi.

## How to ask for demo in chat
Use this case to make demo:
```
Show me demo from file:
Please write in teams to Oleksandr Baglai
Hello from Claude
```

## Important
- Be sure that everytime you tried to write something there is no text from last session, so before you type something press `Ctrl-A`, `Delete`. After you can write.
- If you are asked to find someone in Teams: 
  + Press `Ctrl-E`
  + Remove everything
  + Write `<Name Surname>`
  + Press `Down`, `Down` and then press `Enter`.
  + Remove everything
  + After that you can write your message and then `Enter`.
- Do this in one MCP request.

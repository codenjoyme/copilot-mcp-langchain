## Info
- These instructions are necessary to demonstrate the ability to perform actions in the Chrome browser using hotkeys and winapi.

## How to ask for demo in chat
Use this case to make demo:
```
Show me demo from file:
Open in chrome `google.com` then open a development console and write `hello world` on it.
```

## Important
- Be sure that everytime you tried to write something there is no text from last session, so before you type something press `Ctrl-A`, `Delete`. After you can write.
- If you are asked to open the console in Chrome, use these tips: 
  + `Ctrl-Shift-I` to open devtools.
  + `Ctrl-Shift-P` to open find in devtools
    - Remove everything
    - Then write `Console`
    - And `Enter`
  + Then write `console.log("<text>")` and press `Enter`.Here `<text>` is the text you want to log.
- Do this in one MCP request.

## Tools 
- Use only `lng_winapi_list_process` and `lng_winapi_send_hotkey` tools.

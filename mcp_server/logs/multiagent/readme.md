# Multi-Agent Conversation Logs

This folder (`mcp_server/logs/multiagent/`) contains conversation logs between the user and sub-agents of the multi-agent management system.

## Log Structure

Each sub-agent creates its own log file with a name in the format:
```
{agent_name}_{agent_id_8chars}.log
```

Where:
- `agent_name` - agent name (spaces replaced with underscores)
- `agent_id_8chars` - first 8 characters of the agent's UUID

## Entry Format

### Entry Types:

1. **USER:** - Question from user
2. **AGENT:** - Agent response  
3. **TOOL_USED:** - Tool that was used
4. **TOOL_PARAMS:** - Tool parameters (JSON)
5. **TOOL_RESULT:** - Tool execution result
6. **ERROR:** - Errors during operation

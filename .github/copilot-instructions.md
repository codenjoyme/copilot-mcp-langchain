- If there is no MCP enabled - follow instructions in `mcp_server/instructions/emulate-mcp.agent.md`
  + To verify is MCP ernable read the `.vscode/settings.json` every time you start working.
  + Don't read old chat posts, whenever I make a request - read the file again.
- In any other case activate the virtual environment before starting any python stuff:
```bash
. ./langchain_env/Scripts/activate
```
- Please don't reflect on the instructions read in this or any other file - just follow.
